#
# This ProGuard configuration file specifies how annotations can be used
# to configure the processing of other code.
# Usage:
#     java -jar proguard.jar @annotations.pro -libraryjars annotations.jar ...
#
# Note that the other input/output options still have to be specified.
# If you specify them in a separate file, you can simply include this file:
#     -include annotations.pro
#
# You can add any other options that are required. For instance, if you are
# processing a library, you can still include the options from library.pro.


# The annotations are defined in the accompanying jar. For now, we'll start
# with these. You can always define your own annotations, if necessary.
#-libraryjars annotations.jar

# @KeepImplementations and @KeepPublicImplementations specify to keep all,
